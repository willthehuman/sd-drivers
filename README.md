# Steam Deck Controller Remapper Reborn
Steam Deck Controller Remapper allows users to rebind controls directly. (No virtual xbox 360 stuff, No Steam).

Originally made because it was impossible to play Valorant using other methods (trackpads weren't recognized as mouse)

In other words, this allows you to rebind any button of the steam deck controller to any button of your keyboard/mouse without having to emulate an xbox 360 controller first. 

- BAD: (Steam Deck -> Virtual Xbox 360 Controller -> Emulated Keyboard/Mouse inputs)
- GOOD: (Steam Deck -> *SIMULATED* Keyboard/Mouse inputs)

# How to use

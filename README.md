# [WIP] Steam Deck Controller Remapper
Steam Deck Controller Remapper allows users to rebind controls directly. (No virtual xbox 360 stuff).

Originally made because it was impossible to play Valorant using other methods (trackpads weren't recognized as mouse)

ie.: You press the A button, you can bind it to Space.
